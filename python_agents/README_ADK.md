# Google ADK Integration - Step 3 Complete

## ✅ Implementation Summary

Successfully completed Step 3 of the refactoring plan: **Wrap logic in a Google ADK agent**.

### What Was Implemented

1. **AnalysisAgent (ADK-wrapped)**
   - Inherits from `google.adk.agents.BaseAgent`
   - Maintains original risk analysis logic
   - Added `async run()` method for ADK compatibility
   - Proper agent initialization with name and description

2. **DisasterResponseOrchestrator**
   - Coordinates multiple agents (currently AnalysisAgent)
   - Processes emergency requests with comprehensive output
   - Manages ADK sessions and agent lifecycle
   - Adds emergency action recommendations based on risk levels

3. **Mock Implementation Support**
   - Falls back to mock classes when Google ADK not installed
   - Allows testing and development without full ADK setup
   - Seamless transition between mock and real ADK

4. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - All 22 unit tests still pass
   - Integration tests for orchestrator functionality
   - Example scripts demonstrating full ADK integration

## 🚀 Key Features

### AnalysisAgent Configuration
```python
from agents.analysis_agent import AnalysisAgent

# Initialize with ADK parameters
agent = AnalysisAgent(
    name="disaster_analysis_agent", 
    description="AI agent specialized in disaster response risk assessment"
)

# Agent inherits from BaseAgent and includes:
# - Risk threshold configuration (High: >50°C or >70% smoke)
# - Multi-reading batch processing
# - Detailed reasoning generation
# - ADK session compatibility
```

### Orchestrator Usage
```python
from orchestrator import DisasterResponseOrchestrator

orchestrator = DisasterResponseOrchestrator()
result = await orchestrator.process_emergency_request(sensor_data)

# Result includes:
# - Risk analysis from AnalysisAgent
# - Emergency action recommendations  
# - Priority levels (NORMAL/HIGH/CRITICAL)
# - Agent metadata and processing timestamps
```

## 📊 Example Output

```
🚨 Processing emergency request at 2025-06-17T23:15:38
🔍 Analysis Results:
Overall Risk Level: High
Priority: CRITICAL
Total Readings Processed: 3

📍 Location-Specific Analysis:
  Building A - Floor 3: Low Risk
    • All readings within normal parameters
  Building B - Basement: Medium Risk  
    • Elevated temperature: 45°C
    • Elevated smoke level: 55%
  Building C - Server Room: High Risk
    • Critical temperature: 75°C
    • Dangerous smoke level: 85%

⚡ Recommended Emergency Actions:
  • IMMEDIATE EVACUATION required for affected areas
  • Deploy emergency response teams to high-risk locations
  • Activate fire suppression systems if available
  • Notify emergency services and local authorities
  • Establish emergency communication protocols

🤖 Agent: disaster_analysis_agent
```

## 🧪 Testing Results

- ✅ **All 22 unit tests pass** (same as original implementation)
- ✅ **Orchestrator integration tests pass**
- ✅ **Mock fallback functionality verified**
- ✅ **ADK agent initialization works correctly**
- ✅ **Emergency action recommendations generated properly**

## 🔗 Future Integration Ready

The ADK-wrapped agents are prepared for:

1. **Gemini Model Integration**: Ready to add LLM-powered insights
2. **BigQuery Agent**: Historical data analysis and trend detection  
3. **Notification Agent**: Multi-channel emergency alerts
4. **Express Backend Integration**: Python orchestrator callable from Node.js

## 🛠️ Production Deployment

When Google ADK is installed:
```bash
pip install google-adk
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

The agents automatically use full ADK functionality with Gemini models while maintaining the same interface.
